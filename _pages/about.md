<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the Center for Perceptual and Interactive Intelligence (CPII), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, working with **Prof. Helen Meng** (IEEE Fellow).  

I received my Ph.D. in Electronic and Information Engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2023 (supervised by **Prof. Man-Wai Mak**), and M.Sc. in Communication and Information Systems from Xiamen University in 2020.

My research focuses on **speech and voice signal processing**, **spoken language biomarkers**, **large language models (LLMs) for clinical speech analysis**, and **automatic detection of neurocognitive disorders** (e.g., dementia, Alzheimer's) from spontaneous Cantonese speech.

I am particularly interested in:
- Integrating **pause context**, **prosody**, and **paralinguistic features** into pre-trained LLMs for improved dementia detection
- Developing Cantonese-specific **ASR** systems for clinical conversational speech
- Acoustic/prosodic feature engineering and deep learning-based biomarker selection
- Computational paralinguistics, voice quality analysis, and speech-based healthcare AI
